To load the application via this repository, use either npm run start to run it in development mode, or npm run build to run the build which can then be deployed via the index.html. Once running the application different pages can be selected from the navigation bar on the top right. On the home/Search for Books page users can search for books using the search bar. The user will then see a grid of books. If the user is signed in they will be able to save the books. Saved books can then be viewed from the See Your Books tab where they will also be able to remove books from their saved list.
